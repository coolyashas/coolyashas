## About Me

I’m a **Computer Science student at RV College of Engineering** passionate about **AI, Computer Vision, and Generative Models**.  
I collaborate with **Carnegie Mellon University** on **AI-driven 3D modular assembly**, combining **large language models, physics solvers, and differentiable rendering** for applications in **AR/VR and game development**.  

I also lead **developer communities** as **Google Developers Group Head at RVCE**, where I’ve organized **Gen AI study jams, Build With AI events, and an overnight hackathon with 150+ participants**.  

Previously, at **Pro Test**, I fine-tuned **Vision-Language Models** to automate test-case generation with **sub-second inference latency**, achieving **high coverage alignment** with human-authored test cases.
